Please note that our checkpoint space is larger than the values mentioned in our paper, because the floating-point in these checkpoints are stored with FP32 precision.

If you need checkpoints containing all FP32 precision weights to continue training or fine-tune them for customized capabilities, feel free to contact us (Yuzhuang Xu: xyz21thu@gmail.com). When contacting, please specify the intended use and adhere to the open source protocol.
