Utility that prepares the repository for releases (or patches) by updating all versions in the relevant places. It
also performs some post-release cleanup, by updating the links in the main README to respective model doc pages (from
main to stable).

To prepare for a release, use from the root of the repo on the release branch with:

```bash
python release.py
```

or use `make pre-release`.

To prepare for a patch release, use from the root of the repo on the release branch with:

```bash
python release.py --patch
```

or use `make pre-patch`.

To do the post-release cleanup, use from the root of the repo on the main branch with:

```bash
python release.py --post_release
```

or use `make post-release`.
